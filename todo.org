* List of issues/functions to address (20170201) with decreasing order of priority:
  - Change malloc to calloc in createImg (PK)
  - Add binding of mialib functions in cmake (PK)
  - Add from and to numpy functions, see mialib_python.i (PK)
  - Add UINT64 data type in Jim (PK)
  - ERROR_TYPE functions that do not modify the input image (e.g. iminfo) should not use the bool variable destructive: create list (PS)
  - Address those functions with pointer arguments (besides IMAGE * or IMAGE **): create list (PS), define desired behaviour at python level (PS-PK), and then solve (at interface file level?).
  - Confirm that arguments of overloaded methods with default argument values cannot be used as keys (PK)
  - Solve the problem related to ERROR_TYPE return in a functional call (refers to a memory leak and returned ERROR_TYPE * !!!)
  - Address mialib functions modifying GeoTransform/Projection: create list (PS) and then ad hoc procedure to be put in place.
  - Write a clone at jim level with memcpy to secure correct behaviour for all data types including Int64/UInt64.



* Done:
  - Automatic binding of functions returning an IMAGE * (see template in mean2d in jim.cc) (PS on 20170202)
